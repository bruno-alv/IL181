I took an introductory course on Machine Learning as part of my major. For the length of the semester, we learnt about essential ML tools and explored different models for different real-world problems. We showcased our newly acquired abilities by processing personal data by applying ML tools from and outside class.

For my project, I focused on classifying pictures in my gallery. I would classify Nature, City and Beach images. This was a one vs. all classifier. I approached the task using four progressively better models. These were Linear regression, a Support Vector Machine with Kernel trick, a CNN and a CNN with a transfer learning approach.

For the current iteration, I presented the comparison between each approach and found that the CNN with transfer learning using the ResNet50 pre-trained model worked the best.

For my future update, I will use a LIME approach to asses each model's predictions and what part of the images each classifier is focusing on.
