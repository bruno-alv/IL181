This branch shows my first approach to my AI-learning journey. I first explored Autoencoders and image processing through my professor's recommendation using the https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/autoencoder guide. Out of my interest, I then explored LLMs and their general architecture.

I then created a prompt processor that would generate shapes in different colours and sizes through prompts. I trained my model on several prompts and cases. It was quite a basic approach but effective.

I understand this approach's limitations, but this project helped me better understand the general idea behind AI and how to approach new techniques and models to continue my AI journey.
