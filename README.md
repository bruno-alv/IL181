As part of my major, I took an introductory course on Machine Learning. For the lenght of the semester, we learnt about basic ML tools and eplored different models for different real-world problems. We showcased our newly-acquired abilities through processing personal data by applying ML tools from and outside of class.

For my project, I focused on classifying pictures in my personal galery. I would classify Nature, City and Beach images. This was a 1 vs. all classifier. I approached the task using 4 progressively better models. These were Linear regression, Support Vector Machine with Kernel trick, a CNN and a CNN with a transfer learning approach.

For the current iteration, I presented the comparison between each approach and found that the CNN with a transfer learning using the ResNet50 pre-trained model worked the best.

For my future update, I will use a LIME approach to asses each model's predictions and what part of the images is each classifier focusing on.
